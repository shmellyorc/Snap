# SnapEngine

SnapEngine is a modular C# game engine built on top of [SFML.Net](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml.net/), designed for fast prototyping and embedded resource handling. It is ideal for hobbyist and experimental game developers who want full control over the engine architecture with minimal boilerplate.
